A Ondat node is any machine (virtual or physical) that is running the
Ondat container. Under Kubernetes orchestration a Ondat container
runs as part of a Kubernetes pod on all Kubernetes worker node. Ondat nodes
aggregate host storage and present this storage as Ondat [pools]({{< ref "docs/concepts/pools.md" >}}).
